# AI-Powered Travel Planner

## Overview

The **AI-Powered Travel Planner** is an intelligent application designed to help users create personalized and efficient travel itineraries. It takes into account user preferences such as destination, travel dates, group size, and budget to generate tailored trip plans.

By leveraging **Large Language Models (LLMs)** and real-time data, the planner can suggest flights, accommodations, and tourist attractions that fit the user's criteria. The goal is to streamline the travel planning process, offering a one-stop solution from itinerary generation to personalized recommendations — all within a user-friendly interface.

**Example:**  
Input: “2-day trip to London with a $1000 budget”  
Output: A structured itinerary with activities, accommodations, and timings that align with those preferences.

## Tech Stack

- **Platform:**  
  Web application interface (with potential for mobile extension). Frontend built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript/TypeScript, and React.

- **AI Engine:**  
  Uses a generative AI model (e.g., OpenAI’s GPT-4 or Google’s Gemini) to process natural language prompts and produce structured itineraries.

- **Backend & Database:**  
  Firebase handles backend services including user authentication and real-time database storage. Cloud Functions (Node.js) process AI requests and external API calls.

- **External APIs:**  
  Integrates with third-party APIs (e.g., Skyscanner, Booking.com, Yelp) to gather real-time flight, hotel, and local activity data.

- Collects user input and displays the generated itinerary
- Provides a responsive, intuitive layout for seamless interaction

### 2. AI Planning Module

- Constructs prompts based on user preferences
- Sends requests to the AI model (e.g., GPT-4, Gemini)
- Parses and formats the model output into a structured day-by-day itinerary

### 3. Data Management Module

- Manages user authentication (sign up, login)
- Saves and retrieves user data and trip plans from Firebase Firestore
- Ensures secure and consistent data access

### 4. Integration Module

- Interfaces with external APIs to fetch real-time flight, hotel, and activity data
- Enriches AI-generated itineraries with live pricing and booking options
- Merges external data into the final trip plan
